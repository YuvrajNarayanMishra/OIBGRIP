# Simple-Calculator

A simple Calculator for general purposes.

As we know, the Calculator is a portable device used in our daily life to perform various mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, etc. However, we have scientific or sophisticated calculators used to solve complex tasks such as trigonometry functions, degrees, exponential operators, log functions, hyperbolic functions, square root, and so on.
